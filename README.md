### As with all labs: Commit and push after making progress. This includes but is not limited to 

1. completing a method
2. writing test cases
3. making progress towards a working method even if it isnt completely correct
4. fixing a bug in a method

### Lab 01:

Remember from class: `public static boolean makeBricks(int small, int big, int goal)` - We want to make a row of bricks that is `goal` inches long. We have a number of `small` bricks (1 inch each) and `big` bricks (5 inches each). Return true if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks, otherwise return false.

0. Write many test cases for the `makeBricks()` method including the expected values. 

1. Write the actual `makeBricks()` method in `Functions.java` as per class instructions (e.g. Do not use loops nor recursion to decriment the size.) You must write a single boolean expression that you will return.
2. Write test cases for this problem in your Driver.java . There are examples of how to write test cases for a different function in that file. 

### You should be able to write things from scratch:

3. Now test your [java-fu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fu), write a hello world program from scratch; do not copy/paste it. Name the file `Hello.java`, create a class called Hello, and write a main method that prints `"Hello World, XXX"` to the terminal, where XXX is a fun fact about yourself (that is not longer than 40 characters).

### Include Tester.java from your summer assignment.

4. Add the file `Tester.java` to the repo, and add/commit/push it. This should be next to your `Functions.java` file.
